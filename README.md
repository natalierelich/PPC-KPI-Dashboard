# KPI Dashboard in Excel

## The Business Task

### Create a visually appealing dashboard that allows the user to quickly understand key campaign metrics

A client wanted to better understand how her various Google Ads campaigns had performed over the past year, but she found the Google reporting features confusing and it was time-consuming to extract the information she actually needed.

She needed a dashboard that visualized her campaign metrics in a way that helped her decide how to modify them moving forward to meet her goals.

## My Approach and Solution

I worked with my client to decide which metrics were most important to her business. The end result was an Excel dashboard that displayed this information at a glance.

I downloaded the relevant campaign data from Google Ads and cleaned it so I could use it to create the dashboard.

I then used my data visualization skills to transform the raw data into meaningful insights for my client. This meant understanding how clicks, impressions, conversions, and total cost varied across her campaign.

She was able to take this information and decide which campaigns she would continue to run and which she needed to modify to meet her goals.
